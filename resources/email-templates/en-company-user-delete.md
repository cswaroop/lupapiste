Hello,

{{company.name}}´s company account´s administrator has deleted you from the company account´s users. From now on you can continue working in Lupapiste as a single user. If you haven´t gone through the strong electronic identification, you will be redirected to it using your personal online bank identifiers.

You'll continue having access to those applications to which you have personal mandate. Applications with only company´s mandate will no longer be seen in your application list.

Please go through additional information and guidance on our website: {{lupapiste.help}}.

Best regards,
{{lupapiste.team}}
